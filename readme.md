# Starting the Program
In order to start the Program you first need to initialise the server and enter the server as a client

## Starting the Server
You should start the server by running the server file via the command line in Python.
The format should be as follows:
`python3 server.py <port>`

- Since this server runs on a local network, you may use any port number you wish
- It is best practice to choose a port above 10000

## Connecting the clients
Clients may connect to the server
